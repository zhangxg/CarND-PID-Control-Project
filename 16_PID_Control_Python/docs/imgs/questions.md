## ![bigger_ct](./imgs/bigger_cte.png)
why a systematic bias causes a bigger cte? 
is this relates to the orientation of the bias? 

## ![is the d enough](./imgs/is_d_enough.png)
while i don't know if the d is enough? 
to me, the systematic bias gives some effect to reduce the propotinal effect, 
which acts just like the purpose of the d coeffcients. 
while it also depends on the orientation of the systematic bias.
